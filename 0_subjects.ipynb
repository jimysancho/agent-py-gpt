      "3. In the `os.walk()` loop:\n",
      "   - The code assumes that all files other than `.py` and `__init__.py`\n",
      "should be removed.\n",
      "   - This might not be the desired behavior if you have other\n",
      "types of files in your directory tree.\n",
      "4. `_create_file_node(…)` and `_create_node_relationships_file(…)`: \n",
      "   - These functions are called but their implementation is not provided, so\n",
      "it's difficult to say whether they contain errors or not.\n",
      "5. The function `upload_file_zip` is marked as asynchronous (`async def`), but it doesn't appear to\n",

      "   - If the intention was for this function to be truly asynchronous\n",

      "Upon reviewing the code, I don't see any obvious syntax errors or logical issues that\n",
      "would prevent the function from working as intended.\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n",
      "1. It defines an asynchronous function `get_text_from_node` that takes two arguments: `node_id` (a string) and\n",
      "`db` (an instance of `Session`, which is obtained through dependency injection using `Depends(get_db)`).\n",
      "2. The function uses the `db` object to query a database for a node with\n",
      "the specified `node_id`. If no such node exists, it raises an `HTTPException` with status code\n",
      "404 and a detail message indicating that the node doesn't exist.\n",
      "3. If the node is found, the function queries the database again to retrieve all\n",
      "text data associated with that node (where `parent_node_id` matches the specified `node_id`). It then extracts\n",
      "the text content from each result using a list comprehension (`[text[0] for text in text_data]`)\n",
      "and joins them into a single string.\n",
      "4. The function returns a JSON response containing the joined text data, along with a\n",
      "\"code\" key.\n",
      "Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and easy to follow. However, I do have\n",
      "one minor suggestion:\n",
      "In the `return` statement, you're joining the text data using an empty string (`\"\"`). If\n",
      "there are no texts associated with the node, this will result in an empty string\n",
      "being returned. You might want to consider returning a more informative response (e.g., an empty\n",
      "list or a special value) in such cases.\n",
      "That's my assessment! Without knowing more about the specific use case or any potential issues\n",

      "2. **Unclear naming conventions**: The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable names\n",
      "(e.g., `node_type` vs. `file_id`). While this is not necessarily an error, it can make the\n",
